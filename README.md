Loan Status Prediction (ML Project)

This machine learning project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various applicant details.

Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (SVM, train_test_split, accuracy_score)

Project Overview
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using pandas
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using seaborn
- Trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict loan status
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics

Accuracy
The model achieved an accuracy of **83%** on the test set.

How to Run
- Open the `Loan_Status_Prediction.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
- Run cells in order
- Modify the input data to test predictions
